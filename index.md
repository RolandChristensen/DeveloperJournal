# Test Heading to Make Sure There is no Duplicate

There is a plug in called "jekyll-titles-from-headings" that will create a duplicate heading and title if you do not include a "title" key in the YAML front matter.
From the repo: "If you have a Jekyll page that doesn't have a title specified in the YAML Front Matter, but the first non-whitespace line in the page is a Markdown H1 / H2 / H3, this plugin instructs Jekyll to use that first heading as the page's title."

# The Heading is Below the Summary
